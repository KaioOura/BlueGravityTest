The Dark Wizard on the bottom left side of the screen is the owner of the tavern. We are in the ghost season, and all the ghosts love the Dark Wizard's coffee. He is offering some money if you can help by clearing the tables after the ghosts have finished their coffee. With the money, you can purchase unique pieces of armor and even change your hairstyle!
